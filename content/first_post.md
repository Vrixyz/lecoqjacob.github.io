Welcome to Yendor's Blog! I will be posting about my experiences in programming, technical writing, game development, travel, and other things that I find interesting. I hope you enjoy reading my posts!

I thought a good first post would be choosing user names for the internet. For me, usernames were derived from my gaming days. I had various Gamertags throughout my years of gaming, from `CupCakeMan` to `Posideon`, and my final Gamertag was `BigFatBanana`. `BigFatBanana` was a joke among my friends, mostly in lewd references, but since those younger days, I still find myself enjoying `BigBanana`.

Usernames always seem to convey a smaller piece of our personality. Some choose to have meme usernames that play more into their comedic side, while others choose to have more serious usernames. The main challenge is choosing a username that sticks forever, which is my current dilemma.

For now, I am sticking with `Yendor`, from my love of rougelike games.
